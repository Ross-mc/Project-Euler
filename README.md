# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the mathematical/coding challenges hosted at [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/). I complete this challenges when I have a bit of spare time between the more structured learning and courses I am completing. To date, I have been attempting the challenges in JavaScript, but I am planning to complete more challenges in Python.
